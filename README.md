# Connectome Circuit Search Tool

This is a tool built in Mathematica that allows anyone to import the structure of connectome and search for the minimal subcircuit connecting any two sets of neurons. This can be particularly useful for computational modeling efforts.

The Mathematica Notebook contains step by step instructions using first a toy network, then an example from the Drosophila connectome, and finally an example from the C. elegans Conectome.
